# Dotfiles
All of those sweet configuration files in one place, making setup infinitely easier.
  * Automatically links all of the configuration files into your home directory
  * Make changes and easily push a commit when you see something you like!

# Usage
Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nicholas-Horton/dotfiles.git
```

Run the installer!
```bash
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

Don't worry! If a configuration file already exists, the script will ask you if you
would like to overwrite it!
